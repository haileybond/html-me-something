                <h1>Darcy</h1>
                <p>Darcy is my oldest (and fuzziest!) doxie pup. He's also the biggest
                    trouble maker! He loves digging holes in the backyard, playing in the mud,
                    swimming and fetching sticks in the water, playing fetch with his ball,
                    going for hikes in the woods, and having his belly scratched. Most of all,
                    he loves eating. He is fun, spunky, messy, and a very handsome fella.
