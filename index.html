                <h1>Darcy</h1>
                <p>Darcy is my oldest (and fuzziest!) doxie pup. He's also the biggest
                    trouble maker! He loves digging holes in the backyard, playing in the mud,
                    swimming and fetching sticks in the water, playing fetch with his ball,
                    going for hikes in the woods, and having his belly scratched. Most of all,
                    he loves eating. He is fun, spunky, messy, and a very handsome fella.

                <h1>Lizzie</h1>
                <p>Lizzie is our "middle child"" and she is a very unique little doxie. She is
                    a tiny little girl weighing in at 8 pounds! She is very sweet and loves to
                    snuggle with her humans and her little brother, Bingley. She loves kisses and
                    does an enthusiatic dance every time mom and dad come home. She likes to wait
                    for her brothers to finish their dinner before eating hers, so she can make them
                    very jealous by eating slowly in front of them. She hates swimming but likes to
                    put her paws in the water. She loves to chase ducks and her favorite thing to do
                    is go for a hike with her family.
