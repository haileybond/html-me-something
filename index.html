                <h1>My Little Family</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Hailey! I'm a gal who nevers stops vacumming because I have three adorable, trouble-making, loving and playful 
                    miniature dachshunds who never stop shedding and making muddy messes (I have a husband too- and he also contributes to the need for constant vacuuming!)
                </p> 
                <p>Meet each of my pups below!</p>

                alt="Darcy returning from fetching a large stick in the river, swimming with his head up towards the grassy shore" height="200">
                <p>Darcy is my oldest (and fuzziest!) doxie pup. He's also the biggest
                    trouble maker! He loves digging holes in the backyard, playing in the mud,
                    swimming and fetching sticks in the water, playing fetch with his ball,
                    going for hikes in the woods, and having his belly scratched. Most of all,
                    he loves eating. He is almost always stinky after playing and getting dirty
                    in the rain, so he takes a lot of baths! He doesn't really mind bath time. 
                    He is a pretty freindly guy but he will bark at you if you stop petting him.
                    (MORE PETS PLEASE!) He's been my partner in crime since 2011 and he made me 
                    fall in love with miniature dachshunds! Darcy is fun, spunky, messy, and a 
                    very handsome fella.

                alt="Lizzie sitting in the grass and staring off to the side of the picture" height="200">
                <p>Lizzie is our "middle child"" and she is a very unique little doxie. She is
                    a tiny little girl weighing in at 8 pounds! She is very sweet and loves to
                    snuggle with her humans and her little brother, Bingley. She loves kisses and
                    does an enthusiatic dance every time mom and dad come home. She likes to wait
                    for her brothers to finish their dinner before eating hers, so she can make them
                    very jealous by eating slowly in front of them. She hates swimming but likes to
                    put her paws in the water. She loves to chase ducks and her favorite thing to do
                    is go for a hike with her family. Her bark is shrill and piercing and she hates
                    tiny humans (aka children) because she doesn't understand why they are so short. Strangers always 
                    think Lizzie is the cutest member of the gang, but then she scares them away.

                <p>Bingley is our youngest and most energetic pup. He is the cutest little ball of
                    blonde fuzz that you'll ever see. He's also the sweetest boy and his favorite
                    thing to do is to snuggle with his daddy (or if dad isn't around, he'll settle
                    for snuggles with mom). He loves chasing his little sister around, wrestling with
                    his big brother Darcy and playing keep away with Darcy's favorite ball. He is
                    learning to swim and he is terrible at walking on a leash. He throws a fit if mom
                    and dad leave the house for more than 30 seconds and he needs attention and snuggles
                    constantly. He's a little piggy and loves to eat. He's a clean freak like mom and
                    spends a lot of his down time cleaning his paws (or his brother's ears, or his
                    sister's teeth). He's an adorable little weirdo.
